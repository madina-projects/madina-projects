📈 **Experienced Program Manager | Data-Driven Strategist | SQL Enthusiast | Professional Scrum Matser I**

I’m a Program Manager with extensive experience in Customer Experience (CX), Sales, Marketing, and Operations across high-impact industries, including tourism, e-learning, consulting, and food delivery. My career has focused on implementing data-driven strategies that bridge people, business, and technology to drive results.

🌟 **About Me**

Coming from the business side, I leverage SQL as a powerful tool to gain insights, drive cross-functional collaboration, and make informed decisions. Although my primary role is not technical, SQL has been instrumental in enabling me to work closely with tech and data teams to create impactful, metric-driven products and services.

🛠️ **Skills & Expertise**

- Data-Driven Decision Making: Applying insights to optimize processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer experience.
- Cross-Functional Collaboration: Facilitating collaboration between business and technical teams to ensure data initiatives support broader strategic goals.

Proficient in **BigQuery, Looker Studio, Tableau, Excel**, and **Google Sheets** for creating dashboards, automating reports, and delivering actionable insights.

📚 **Portfolio Goals**
This portfolio is a showcase of SQL projects and queries I’ve built to solve real-world business challenges. Each project demonstrates how I use SQL to support and improve operations, optimize workflows, and contribute to data-informed strategies across different areas. I focus on projects where SQL was integral in driving cross-functional insights, improving efficiency, and ensuring metric-based decision-making.
